    "content": " How to promote the Quality Best Practices Influence or evangelize  Data-Driven decisions   Enforce  \r How to promote the Quality Best Practices Two ways to promote the quality best practices are: Influencing the teams or to enforce the best practices. A periodical team reality check about the current practices is the beginning of the process. A team can easily live in their own Ivory Tower or to be biased by this statement: “We always did it that way so why changing it?”.\nInfluence or evangelize  Discussions: gather information about current pain points (retrospectives and lessons learned) Involve QA Specialists in all SDLC (or Software Development Life Cycle) 1:1 meetings to get information and expose point of views, share ideas and explain the best practices: it may be easier to convince on person than a group Talk to the teams Provide existing articles and blog posts Tech talk to expose the vision Create training material: guidelines, processes, videos (e.g.: Pluralsight, etc.) Involve people in quality solutions:  Organize Workshops (on short term) so that the targeted public becomes active participants Organize Work Groups (on long term) so that the concerned people become active participants   To use data as leverage; more information is available in the data-driven decision section  Data-Driven decisions To show metrics of the current situation (or challenge the “no metrics” or lack of metrics). It is the also called “Shift-Right” approach in the Software Quality world.\n End-users or Customers survey can be used (e.g.: use a post-transaction experience survey on the mobile app or web site) White-Label partner surveys Use production dashboards (examples: Datadog or SignalFX metrics) and performance tools (e.g.: WebVitals, etc.) to monitor APIs, SQLs, etc.  Daily performance emails can be sent to the engineering teams   NPS and CSAT surveys: NPS vs CSAT definitions Real Customers Journey (traces of the end-users through the applications) Use support CIM dashboards: customer tickets, production tickets, ticket aging/bug fix time, tickets by services or teams, RCA (find the issues caused by quality process)  CIM stands for Customer Interaction Management A way to generate CIM data is to use a tool like eazy bi   Correlation between test coverage (static code) and production issues  It is also possible to get test coverage from a live service using a tool like Sealights   Compile the functional testers (manual tests) created Tickets/JIRA vs current team or service test coverage Create Success Stories: start with one team and use the before/after statistics GIT statistics (e.g. with a tool like GitPrime (now Pluralsight Flow)) in order to correlate bugs/tickets and developers stats (e.g.: number of commits, active days, etc.)  I.e.: low stats may be caused by developers not working on features or test automations because they are working on manual tests or production support   Correlate the release cycle (how often the team releases or time to market) and test coverage; better/reliable test coverage and test regression suite will shorten the release cycle. Gather statistic about how much time it takes to refactor an existing feature? Better test coverage will result in faster refactoring  Enforce  Contact the best practices stakeholders and ask for support (I.e.: to push the best practices downward) To fix deadlines (must be adopted by specific dates) Enforce with Gates, checklists, DoD, etc. Set Quality specific OKRs Assign Quality trainings  ",

 }   // Static method  static void myStaticMethod() {  // A static method does not rely on any non-static attribute or member.  } } Static vs Non-Static members  Non-Static Member: is accessible from an instance and belongs to that instance Static Member: is accessible through the class and belongs to that class  Static members can be accessed using the class name, example:    Enum blueprint // Enum blueprint public enum MyEnum {  CONSTANT1,  CONSTANT2,  ...,  CONSTANTN } Main class blueprint // Main class public class Main {  public static void main(String[] arg) {  MyClass myClass = new MyClass('abc'); // Create an object of type MyClass   myClass.myMethod('xyz'); // Call a method from my object  }  } Princibles Encapsulation  allow us to bind together data and related functionality prevent classes from becoming tightly coupled easily modify the inner workings of one class without affecting the rest of the program restrictions  we need a clear interface between a given class and the rest of the program everything can’t have direct access   make the class attributes hideen from other classes using encapsulation provide a clear interface through public methods benefits  clear pathways for classes to communicate less code changes required for a refactoring change less likely for an attribute to be overwritten with an invalid or null value unexpectedly   Access Modifiers in Java:  private: only visible in class that the member lives in no modifier: only visible in package the member lives in protected: visible to the package and all subclasses public: accessible everywhere within the program    Inheritance  allow us to create class hierarchies Subclass (child class)  inherits properties referred to as the child class   Superclass (parent class)  is inherited from referred to as the parent class   promotes code reusability and scalability leveraging inheritance:  a class can only have one superclass but multiple subclasses if multiple super classes is needed then multilevel inheritance is required    public class MySuperClass {  protected String a1;  private String a2;   MySuperClass(String a1, String a2) {  // Super Class constructor  this.a1 = a1;  this.a2 = a2;  }   public void myMethod() {  // Method of the Super Class  } }  public class MySubClass extends MySuperClass {  MySubClass(String arg1, String arg2) {  super(arg1, arg2); // call superclass with arguments  // Sub Class constructor  }   public String getA1() {  return super.a1; // this.a1 would also work for this Superclass protected variable;  }   @Override  public void myMethod() {  // Override the Super Class Method within the Sub Class  } } Polymorphism  the ability for an object or function to take amny different forms Java supports two types of polymorphism: run time and compile-time polymorphism it helps to reduce complexity and write reusable code  Abstraction   helps us with hide implementation complexity\n  Java supports abstact classes and interfaces\n  helps by fixing inputs and outputs and giving general idea of what the system does\n  an abstract class:\n almost like a template can’t be instencied other classes can extend the abstract calss and implement the appropriate functionality    an example of an abstract class:\npublic abstract class myAbstractClass {  // The class requires the `abstract` keyword since it contains an abstract method.   private final String myString; // final String (aka constant)   protected abstract void myAbstractMethod(); // an abstract method is not implemented! }  public class myOtherClass extends MyAbstractClass {  // variables, constructors... etc.   @Override  protected abstract void myAbstractMethod() {  // The abstract method from the abstract class must be implemented by the sub-class.  } }   an interface is:\n a set of method signatures for to-be-implemented functionality a specification for a set of behaviors without implementation can’t be instencied   public interface MyInterface {  Long myMethod1(); // No method implementation  void myMethod2();  }   public class myClassImplementingMyInterface implements MyInterface {  @Override  public Long myMethod1() {  // the implementation for myMethod1 method  }   @Override  public void myMethod2() {  // the implementation for myMethod2 method  }  }   Consider using abstract classes if any of these statements apply to your situation:\n In the java application, there are some related classes that need to share some lines of code then you can put these lines of code within the abstract class and this abstract class should be extended by all these related classes. You can define the non-static or non-final field(s) in the abstract class so that via a method you can access and modify the state of the Object to which they belong. You can expect that the classes that extend an abstract class have many common methods or fields, or require access modifiers other than public (such as protected and private).    Consider using interfaces if any of these statements apply to your situation:\n It is a total abstraction, All methods declared within an interface must be implemented by the class(es) that implements this interface. A class can implement more than one interface. It is called multiple inheritances. You want to specify the behaviour of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements its behaviour.    Usefull build-in JAVA commands and other information  System.out.println(“string…”);  Method Reference Operator (or ::)   a method reference operator (or ::) is used to call a method by referring to it with the help of its class directly\n like using a lambda expression, example:   // Get the stream  Stream\u003cString\u003e stream  = Stream.of(\"Geeks\", \"For\",  \"Geeks\", \"A\",  \"Computer\",  \"Portal\");   // Print the stream using lambda method:  stream.forEach(s -\u003e System.out.println(s));   // Print the stream using double colon operator  stream.forEach(System.out::println);   // Both lambda and :: will do the same thing.   The Arbitrary Number of Arguments (or ... as a function argument)  it means that zero or more String objects (or a single array of them) may be passed as the argument(s) for that method Reference : [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/javaOO/arguments.html#varargs] important note:  the argument(s) passed in this way is always an array - even if there’s just one. Make sure you treat it that way in the method body the argument that gets the ... must be the last in the method signature. So, myMethod(int i, String… strings) is okay, but myMethod(String… strings, int i) is not okay   example:   public static int myFunction (int ... a) {  int sum = 0;  for (int i : a)  sum += i;   return sum;  }  public static void main( String args[] ) {  int ans = myFunction(1,1,1); // could have any number of arguments  System.out.println( \"Result is \"+ ans );  } Predicate   a Predicate in general meaning is a statement about something that is either true or false. In programming, predicates represent single argument functions that return a boolean value\n  example:\n @FunctionalInterface  public interface Predicate\u003cT\u003e {  boolean test(T t);  }   An example with filter() since it does accept a Predicate as parameter:\n // With lambda function:  List\u003cInteger\u003e list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);  List\u003cInteger\u003e collect = list.stream().filter(x -\u003e x \u003e 5).collect(Collectors.toList());  System.out.println(collect); // [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]   // With predicate:  Predicate\u003cInteger\u003e noGreaterThan5 = x -\u003e x \u003e 5;  List\u003cInteger\u003e list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);  List\u003cInteger\u003e collect = list.stream().filter(noGreaterThan5).collect(Collectors.toList());  System.out.println(collect); // [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]   More examples with Java 8 Predicate Examples\n  The final keyword  Java final keyword is a non-access specifier that is used to restrict a class, variable, and method. If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value if we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses if we declare a class as final, we restrict the other classes to inherit or extend it example:  final variables: to create constants final classes: to prevent inheritance final methods: to prevent method overriding    Generics   using generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces and methods.\n  using generics give many benefits over using non-generic code\n  stronger type checks at compile time:\n Java compiler applies strong type checking to generic code and issues errors if the code violates type safety. Fixing compile-time errors is easier than fixing runtime errors, which can be difficult to find example:   // Without Generics  List list = new ArrayList();  list.add(\"hello\");   // With Generics  List\u003cInteger\u003e list = new ArrayList\u003cInteger\u003e();  list.add(\"hello\"); // will not compile   enabling programmers to implement generic algorithms\n by using generics, programmers can implement generic algorithms that work on collections of different types, can be customized, and are type safe and easier to read.    elimination of casts\n example:   // Without Generics:  List list = new ArrayList();  list.add(\"hello\");  String s = (String) list.get(0); // Need to cast return value to String   // With Generics:  List\u003cString\u003e list = new ArrayList\u003cString\u003e();  list.add(\"hello\");  String s = list.get(0); // no cast needed   Generics type parameters:\n T: Type E: Element K: Key (used in Map) N: Number V: Value (used in Map)    Reference: [https://www.journaldev.com/1663/java-generics-example-method-class-interface]\n  ",

Support rapid development Remove boilerplate of application setup Many uses Cloud Native support but also traditional  Key Aspects  Embedded tomacat (or others) Auto-configuration of Application Context Automatic Servlet Mappings Database support and Hibermate/JPA dialect Automatic Controller Mappings  Auto Config  Default opiniated configuration Very to override defaults Configuration on presence  Spring Initializr  start.spring.io Spring Boot: pick latest released version (ie. 2.5.6)  Packaging: Jar   Add Dependencies:  Pring Web TBD…   Generate  Now it can build and run as is:\n java -jar target/xyz-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\n Use Chrome: localhost:8080\nInversion of Control  Container mainains your class dependencies Objects injected at runtime or startup time An object accepts the dependencies for construction instead of constructing them  Spring IoC  Bean Factory Application Context References Analysis of construction order  Proxies  Beans in Bean Faactory are proxied Annitations drive proxies Annitations are easy extension points, for your own abstracts too Method calling order matters  Data Access in Spring Spring Data  Provides a common set of interfaces Provides a common naming convention Provides aspected behavior Provides Repository and Data Mapping convention  Benefits of Spring Data  Remove boilerplate code Allows for swapping datasources easier Allows to focus on buisiness logic  Key Components  Repository Interface Entity Object DataSource no accessed directly  Embeedded DB with Spring Boot Needed dependencies:\norg.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa\rcom.h2database:h2 Set application.properties:\n logging.level.org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.init.ScriptUtils=debug : by default is set to info spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none : don’t create schema, and just connect to DB  Repository with Spring Data   Java Persistence API (or JPA)\n Mapping Java objects to DB tables and vice versa is called Object-relational Mapping (ORM) JPA permits the developer to works directly with objects rather tahn with SQL statements Based on Annotations    Entity\n A class which should be persisted in a database it must be annotated with javax.persistence.Entity JPA uses a database table for every entity Persisted instances of the class will be represented as one row in the table JPA allows to auto-generate the primary key in the database via the @GeneratedValue annotation By default, the table name corresponds to the class name. You can change this with the addition to the annotation @Table(name=\"NEWTABLENAME\")    \rCode Example\r@Entity @Table(name=\"ROOM\") public class Room {  @Id  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)  @Column(name=\"ROOM_ID\")  private long id;  @Column(name=\"NAME\")  private String name;  @Column(name=\"ROOM_NUMBER\")  private String roomNumber;  @Column(name=\"BED_INFO\")  private String bedInfo;   public long getId() {  return id;  }   public void setId(long id) {  this.id = id;  }   public String getName() {  return name;  }   public void setName(String name) {  this.name = name;  }   public String getRoomNumber() {  return roomNumber;  }   public void setRoomNumber(String roomNumber) {  this.roomNumber = roomNumber;  }   public String getBedInfo() {  return bedInfo;  }   public void setBedInfo(String bedInfo) {  this.bedInfo = bedInfo;  }   @Override  public String toString() {  return \"Room{\" +  \"id=\" + id +  \", name='\" + name + '\\'' +  \", roomNumber='\" + roomNumber + '\\'' +  \", bedInfo='\" + bedInfo + '\\'' +  '}';  } } \r Create a CrudRepository interface for the created Entity:  \rCode Example\r@Repository public interface RoomRepository extends CrudRepository\u003cRoom, Long\u003e {  // Room is the Entity class  // Long is the ID type } \r  Create a Component Event:\n A @Component Annotation is automatically picked by Spring    \rCode Example\r@Component public class AppStartupEvent implements ApplicationListener\u003cApplicationReadyEvent\u003e {  private final RoomRepository roomRepository;   public AppStartupEvent(RoomRepository roomRepository) {  this.roomRepository = roomRepository;  }   @Override  public void onApplicationEvent(ApplicationReadyEvent event) {  Iterable\u003cRoom\u003e rooms = this.roomRepository.findAll();  rooms.forEach(System.out::println);  } } \rUsing remote database Replace the H2 database for an other database, example a PostgreSQL:\ndependencies: org.postgresql:postgresql In application.properties:\nspring.jpa.database=postgresql\rspring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dev\rspring.datasource.username=postgres\rspring.datasource.password=postgres Service Tier Utilizing IoC Why use IoC?\n Allows you to focus on contracts Develoip business code only, leave constuction to the container Build intermediate abstractions Produce clean code  Srping and IoC:\n IoC container is configured by developer Spring maintains handles to objects constucted at startup Spring serves singletons to classes during construction Spring maintains lifecycle of beans Developer only accesses the application context  Service abstraction Why building Service Abstractions:\n Encapsulate layers? Abstract 3rd partys APIs Simplify implementations Swap out implementations as runtime (ie. factory pattern)  How to build one?\n Define our interface (or class) Create the API Inject the dependencies Annotate or configure (classes) Code the implemantation  Spring Service Object  We mark beans with @Service to indicate that they’re holding the business logic. Besides being used in the service layer, there isn’t any other special use for this annotation. Starting with Spring 2.5, the framework introduced annotations-driven Dependency Injection. The main annotation of this feature is @Autowired. It allows Spring to resolve and inject collaborating beans into our bean.  Using @Autowired or either properties or setters/getters isn’t a good practice or easy to test; Use final properties with constructors to have immutable object. If more than one constructor is defined then using @Autowired on the default one will make Spring to use it.    \rCode Example\r@Service public class ReservationService {  private final RoomRepository roomRepository;  private final GuestRepository guestRepository;  private final ReservationRepository reservationRepository;   @Autowired // optional if only one constructor  public ReservationService(RoomRepository roomRepository, GuestRepository guestRepository, ReservationRepository reservationRepository) {  this.roomRepository = roomRepository;  this.guestRepository = guestRepository;  this.reservationRepository = reservationRepository;  }   // Business logic here... } \rWeb pages with Spring Controller Model View Controller (or MVC)\n Fundamental pattern for Web application development The Model is the data The View is the visual display that is populated The Controller wires the view with the model  Spring Controller\n Spring bean Annotated for the servlet mapping Responds to incoming web requests Output a view or raw data  Template Engines\n Spring supports several Thymeleaf most popular Provides a DSL for HTML leaving raw html documents Placeholders for dynamic data Rendiring engin allows for final products  \rCode Example\r@Controller @RequestMapping(\"/reservations\") public class RoomReservationController {   private final DateUtils dateUtils;  private final ReservationService reservationService;   public RoomReservationController(DateUtils dateUtils, ReservationService reservationService) {  this.dateUtils = dateUtils;  this.reservationService = reservationService;  }   @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)  public String getReservations(@RequestParam(value=\"date\", required=false) String dateString, Model model){  Date date = this.dateUtils.createDateFromDateString(dateString);  List\u003cRoomReservation\u003e roomReservations = this.reservationService.getRoomReservationsForDate(date);  model.addAttribute(\"roomReservations\", roomReservations);  return \"roomres\";  } } \rCan use Thymeleaf to create HTML pages.\n Add the web page to src/main/resources/templates  ",
