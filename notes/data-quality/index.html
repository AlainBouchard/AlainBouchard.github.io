In the Data and Business Intelligence domain, Data Quality refers to the overall accuracy, completeness, reliability, and relevance of data, ensuring that it is fit for its intended use In essence, Data Quality ensures that the data used in business intelligence efforts is trustworthy, allowing for accurate analysis, reporting, and decision-making Data quality is defined by how well a given dataset meets a user’s need. Data quality is an important criteria for ensuring that data-driven decisions are made as accurately as possible What is Data Quality Management (DQM) and its pillars? People: the involvement of the data stewards, analyst and business users who are responsible for setting data standards, monitoring quality, and resolving issues. These roles ensure alignment alignment between business needs and the data used to support them. Data Profiling: a critical step that involves analyzing the current state of the data by examining its structure, patterns, and anomalies. Data profiling helps uncover quality issues such as duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies, enabling organizations to identify areas needing improvement. It is initiated to understand the current state of existing data by comparing data to data standards as set by the DQM, used to define the benchmarks to evaluate the improvements. Defining Data Quality: establishing clear, measurable data quality dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, timeliness and consistency. These criteria are developed based on business needs and objectives, ensuring that data supports decision-making and operations effectively. What the data should look like, and it is based on the business goals Data Reporting: providing regular insights and metrics on the state of data quality through dashboards audits, and scorecards. This reporting enable stakeholders to monitor progress, identify trends, and make informed decisions about improvements and corrective actions. It will return the DQM “return on the investment” (ROI), and how data compares to the defined data quality benchmarks. Data Fixing: implementing corrective actions to resolve data quality issues, including data cleansing, standardization, and deduplication. It also involves root cause analysis to prevent recurring issues by addressing underlying process or system flaws. It is intended to repair the data that doesn’t meet the defined data quality benchmarks and standards. Improving data to the required standards. Most important pillar is probably the People one.">

<h3 id="what-is-data-quality-definition">What is Data Quality Definition?</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the Data and Business Intelligence domain, Data Quality refers to the overall accuracy, completeness, reliability, and relevance of data, ensuring that it is fit for its intended use</li>
<li>In essence, Data Quality ensures that the data used in business intelligence efforts is trustworthy, allowing for accurate analysis, reporting, and decision-making</li>
<li>Data quality is defined by how well a given dataset meets a user&rsquo;s need. Data quality is an important criteria for ensuring that data-driven decisions are made as accurately as possible</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-data-quality-management-dqm-and-its-pillars">What is Data Quality Management (DQM) and its pillars?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>People</strong>: the involvement of the data stewards, analyst and business users who are responsible for setting data standards, monitoring quality, and resolving issues. These roles ensure alignment alignment between business needs and the data used to support them.</li>
<li><strong>Data Profiling</strong>: a critical step that involves analyzing the current state of the data by examining its structure, patterns, and anomalies. Data profiling helps uncover quality issues such as duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies, enabling organizations to identify areas needing improvement. It is initiated to understand the current state of existing data by comparing data to data standards as set by the DQM, used to define the benchmarks to evaluate the improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Defining Data Quality</strong>: establishing clear, measurable data quality dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, timeliness and consistency. These criteria are developed based on business needs and objectives, ensuring that data supports decision-making and operations effectively. What the data should look like, and it is based on the business goals</li>
<li><strong>Data Reporting</strong>: providing regular insights and metrics on the state of data quality through dashboards audits, and scorecards. This reporting enable stakeholders to monitor progress, identify trends, and make informed decisions about improvements and corrective actions. It will return the DQM &ldquo;return on the investment&rdquo; (ROI), and how data compares to the defined data quality benchmarks.</li>
<li><strong>Data Fixing</strong>: implementing corrective actions to resolve data quality issues, including data cleansing, standardization, and deduplication. It also involves root cause analysis to prevent recurring issues by addressing underlying process or system flaws. It is intended to repair the data that doesn&rsquo;t meet the defined data quality benchmarks and standards. Improving data to the required standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most important pillar is probably the People one.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-impact-of-poor-data-quality">What is the Impact of Poor Data Quality</h3>
<p>Poor data quality can have significant negative impacts on a business across various dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>decision-making,</li>
<li>operational efficiency,</li>
<li>financial performance/missed opportunities, and</li>
<li>customer trust/reputation risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key impacts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inaccurate Decision-Making</strong>: poor data quality leads to faulty analysis and reporting, causing executives and managers to base strategic and operation decisions on incorrect or incomplete information. This can result in missed opportunities, flawed strategies, or inappropriate response to market conditions. The data based decisions and policies are only as good as the data they are based on.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Operational Efficiency</strong>: when data is inaccurate or inconsistent, processes such ad data integration, analysis, and reporting take longer and require more manual intervention. This leads to inefficiencies, increased labor costs, and delayed operations, affecting productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Losses</strong>: poor data quality can directly impact revenue by causing billing errors, incorrect pricing, or inventory mismanagement. It also increases costs due to rework compliance fines, or failed marking campaigns based on bad data. For example, failure to deliver service to customers or failure to sale the relevant contacts.</li>
<li><strong>Customer dissatisfaction</strong>: errors in customer data, such as wrong addresses or incorrect orders, can result in poor customer experiences, damaged relationships, and loss of trust. This can lead to increased customer churn and negative brand reputation.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory and Compliance risks</strong>:: in industries with strict regulatory requirements (e.g., finance, healthcare, etc), poor data quality can lead to non-compliance, legal penalties, and damage to the organization&rsquo;s credibility. For example, GDPR issues and negative media coverage.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of competitive advantage</strong>: businesses that fail to manage data quality effectively may fall behind competitors that leverage clean, accurate data for better market insights, customer targeting, and innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In In a Nutshell, poor data quality undermines the reliability and value of business intelligence (BI)., impacting nearly every aspect of the business, from dat-to-day operations to long-term growth and competitiveness.</p>
<h3 id="real-life-examples">Real-life Examples</h3>
<p>There are several real-life examples where poor data quality had a significant impact on businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knight Capital Group</strong>: in 2012, a software glitch caused the firm to make unintended stock trades, resulting in a $ 440 million loss within 45 minutes. This error was linked to poor data handling and led to the firm&rsquo;s eventual bankruptcy. [<a href="https://www.getrightdata.com/resources/why-quality-matters-the-10-biggest-data-quality-disasters" rel="external" target="_blank">GetRightData</a>]</li>
<li>**Boeing 747 Max Crashes: Faulty sensor data triggered the automated flight control system, contributing to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. Boeing lost billions, and the incidents resulted in the grounding of all 737 Max planes. [<a href="https://www.getrightdata.com/resources/why-quality-matters-the-10-biggest-data-quality-disasters" rel="external" target="_blank">GetRightData</a>]</li>
<li><strong>UK Passport Agency</strong>: in 1999, data migration errors during a system upgrade delayed the insurance of 500K passports. The fallout from these data issues led to public outrage and a cost of around £12.6 millions to resolve. [<a href="https://www.getrightdata.com/resources/why-quality-matters-the-10-biggest-data-quality-disasters" rel="external" target="_blank">GetRightData</a>]</li>
<li><strong>NASA Mars Orbiter</strong>: NASA lost a $125 million Mars orbiter because a Lockheed Martin engineering team used English units of measurement while the agency&rsquo;s team used the more conventional metric system for a key spacecraft operation. [<a href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9909/30/mars.metric.02/" rel="external" target="_blank">CNN_NASA</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples demonstrate how critical accurate data is in preventing financial losses, reputation damage, and even human safety risks.</p>

<h2 id="causes-of-bad-data">Causes of Bad Data</h2>
<p>Bad data can arise due to due to various reasons, typically stemming from issues in data collection, management, and governance. Here are some reasons why we encounter poor data quality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human Error</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual Data Entry</strong>: people can make mistakes when entering data, leading to inaccuracies, misspellings, and incomplete records. For example, typographical errors or incorrect formatting can lead to inconsistencies in databases.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Training</strong>: when data entry personnel aren&rsquo;t adequately trained, they may unintentionally introduce systemic errors. This happens when employees unknowingly enter incomplete or incorrect data, which accumulates and impacts the overall quality of the dataset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate Data Validation</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Missing Validation Rules</strong>: without proper validation checks, systems can let through invalid data like incorrect formats or data types (for instance, entering letters when numbers are expected). These gaps can lead to faulty or unusable data being stored.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent Standards</strong>: when different departments or systems use varying data formats and standards, it results in inconsistencies across the organization, making it difficult to maintain clean and reliable data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Integration Errors</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data from Multiple Sources</strong>: merging data from various sources, such as legacy systems or third-party vendors, often introduces discrepancies. Differences in data structures or formats can lead to duplicated records, missing information, or incorrect data being captured.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Mapping or Transformation</strong>: during migrations or updates, if data fields aren&rsquo;t mapped properly, or if transformation rules are incorrect, it can lead to distorted or corrupted data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outdated Information</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stale Data</strong>: information can become outdated if not updated regularly. This is especially common with customer records like contact details, which change frequently over time.</li>
<li><strong>Lag in Data Updates</strong>: some systems don&rsquo;t update data in real time, leading to discrepancies between what&rsquo;s recorded and actual events, which can cause issues in decision-making.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Data Governance</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Clear Ownership</strong>: when there&rsquo;s no assigned responsibility for data management, inconsistent practices across departments can result in poor data quality. Without ownership, it&rsquo;s hard to maintain data standards.</li>
<li><strong>Unstructured Data Management</strong>: without clear policies and structured processes for managing storing, and cleaning data, its quality tends to degrade, leading to inaccurate or complete data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete Data</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Partial Data Entry</strong>: sometimes, important data fields are left out during entry, leading to incomplete records. This can happen when systems don&rsquo;t enforce required fields, making the data unreliable.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy Systems</strong>: older systems might not capture all necessary data, leaving gaps when this information i used in modern analytics or business intelligence platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technical Errors</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>System Failures</strong>: technical issues like system crashes, corrupted files, or failed data transfers can lead to incomplete or inaccurate data.</li>
<li><strong>Software Bugs</strong>: bugs in data processing tools or software can introduce errors, reading faulty data that affects overall insights and decision-making.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In In a Nutshell, each of these factors highlights the need for solid <strong>DQM</strong> practices, such as robust validation, regular data cleaning, and strong governance to keep data accurate and reliable.</p>
<h2 id="data-quality-dimensions">Data Quality Dimensions</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Data Quality Dimensions</strong> refer to the different ways we measure how good our data is.</p>
<pre class="mermaid align-center ">flowchart TB
  DQD(Data Quality Dimensions) &lt;--&gt; Validity
  DQD &lt;--&gt; Timeliness
  DQD &lt;--&gt; Completeness
  DQD &lt;--&gt; Uniqueness
  DQD &lt;--&gt; Consistency
  DQD &lt;--&gt; Accuracy
  DQD &lt;--&gt; Integrity</pre>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some of the most recognized dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: this is all about how closely the data matches real-world facts. If your data doesn’t reflect reality, it can lead to bad decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Completeness</strong>: it checks if all the necessary information is present. Missing data can leave important gaps, making the data unreliable.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: data should be the same across all systems. For example, if one database says a customer lives in New York and another says they live in California, that&rsquo;s inconsistent and can cause confusion.</li>
<li><strong>Timelessness</strong>: how current is the data? Old or delayed information can lead to missed opportunities or wrong In a Nutshells.</li>
<li><strong>Validity</strong>: this looks at whether the data follows the required rules or formats. For instance, you wouldn’t want letters in a field that should only have numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Uniqueness</strong>: there shouldn’t be duplicates. If the same person or thing is entered twice, it skews the results and creates inefficiencies.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: this ensures that relationships within the data are properly maintained. For example, if a customer is linked to an order, that link should always stay intact.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, these dimensions help ensure that your data is trustworthy and usable for making informed business decisions.</p>

<li><strong>Customer 103</strong>: The <strong>Last Updated</strong> date is from 2021, making this record outdated. Since the address and contact details haven&rsquo;t been verified or updated in over two years, it&rsquo;s possible that the data is no longer accurate.</li>
<li><strong>Customer 104</strong>: The data was last updated in early 2022, which also makes it outdated for a customer who might have changed address or contact information since then.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outdated records like these could lead to problems such as sending communications or deliveries to the wrong address, missing customer preferences, or failing to capture changes that impact business decisions. Timely data updates are crucial to maintaining the reliability of customer information.</p>

<p><strong>Validity Issues</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer 103</strong>: The email address &ldquo;jonh.smtih@email..com&rdquo; contains a formatting error (extra period before &ldquo;.com&rdquo;), which is invalid.</li>
<li><strong>Customer 104</strong>: The email &ldquo;emma@invalidemail@com&rdquo; has two &ldquo;@&rdquo; symbols, which is not allowed in email formatting, making it invalid.</li>
</ul>
<p>In cases like these, data validity rules (e.g., proper email formats, correct zip code length, or valid data types) must be enforced. Invalid data such as incorrect email formats could result in failed communications and missed customer interactions, highlighting the importance of ensuring data conforms to required standards.</p>

<p><strong>Uniqueness Issues</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer 101 and Customer 105</strong>: These entries are duplicates, representing the same individual (John Smith) with identical information (address, email, etc.). However, they have different <strong>Customer IDs</strong>, which indicates a lack of uniqueness in the dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Duplicate records like this can lead to inefficiencies, such as multiple mailings to the same person, errors in customer segmentation, and skewed analytics. Ensuring uniqueness, especially in key fields like Customer ID or email, is crucial to maintaining data integrity.</p>

<p><strong>Integrity Issues</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer ID in Order Table</strong>: In the Order Table, <strong>Order 5002</strong> refers to <strong>Customer ID 105</strong>, which does not exist in the <strong>Customer Table</strong>. This indicates a <strong>referential integrity</strong> problem, where a record in the Order Table is pointing to a non-existent customer.</li>
<li><strong>Mismatch of Addresses</strong>: In the Customer Table, <strong>Customer 103</strong> has the same address as <strong>Customer 101</strong> but with variations (e.g., &ldquo;Elm Street&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Elm St.&rdquo;), which could also indicate an integrity issue in maintaining consistent data relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data integrity ensures that relationships between tables (e.g., customer and order data) are accurate and complete. Integrity issues like these can lead to broken reporting, incorrect data analysis, and operational inefficiencies.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-data-quality-dimensions-issues">Multiple Data Quality Dimensions Issues</h3>
<p>A single issue, like an address problem, can involve <strong>multiple data quality dimensions</strong> at once. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: if the address is wrong (e.g., &ldquo;123 Elm St&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;321 Elm St&rdquo;), it’s an accuracy issue. This can cause real problems, like sending packages to the wrong place or communicating with the customer at the wrong address.</li>
<li><strong>Completeness</strong>: if part of the address is missing, such as no zip code or an incomplete street name (e.g., “Elm St” without the house number), that’s a completeness issue. Without the full details, the address may not be useful, and the business can&rsquo;t function properly.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: data integrity is about making sure information is consistent across systems. If one system shows &ldquo;123 Elm St&rdquo; and another has &ldquo;456 Oak Ave&rdquo; for the same person, it’s an integrity problem, as these records don&rsquo;t match.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, a simple issue like an incorrect or incomplete address can affect <strong>accuracy</strong>, <strong>completeness</strong>, and <strong>integrity</strong> all at the same time, making it crucial to fix the issue from multiple angles to ensure the data is reliable.</p>
<h2 id="data-quality-rules">Data Quality Rules</h2>
<p>The <strong>Data Quality Rules</strong>, also called <strong>Data Validation Rules</strong>, are guidelines that defines what <strong>good data</strong> looks like. They specify the conditions data must meet to be accurate, complete, consistent and usable for its purpose.</p>
<p>The Data Quality rules are the technical implementation of the Business rules designed to meet stakeholders&rsquo; expectations for reliable, consistent and useful data. They ensure that the data supports both business operations and decision-making effectively.</p>
<h3 id="what">What?</h3>
<p>The following rules make sure the data stays useful and trustworthy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear and Specific</strong>: the rules clearly define what <strong>good data</strong> looks like, like &ldquo;every email must included an @ symbol&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant</strong>: The rules are based on what matters for your business or how the data will be used.</li>
<li><strong>Helpful</strong>: The rules make it easy to spot and fix issues when data doesn&rsquo;t meet the standards.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic</strong>: The rules can be applied using tools or scripts to regularly check the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples-of-data-quality-rules">Examples of Data Quality Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completeness rules</strong>: No important fields should be empty (e.g., every customer must have an email address).</li>
<li><strong>Uniqueness rule</strong>: No duplicates (e.g., every OrderID must be unique).</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy rule</strong>: Data should match real-world values (e.g., a zip code must match its city).</li>
<li><strong>Consistency rule</strong>: Related data should align across systems (e.g., a user status should be the same in all databases).</li>
<li><strong>Validity rule</strong>: Data should follow rules or formats (e.g., dates must be in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Timeliness</strong>: Data should be up-to-date (e.g., transaction must be processed within 24 hours).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>These rules help identify errors, maintain trust in the data, and ensure it&rsquo;s useful for decision-making and compliance. They are checklist to keep the data clean and reliable.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-define-the-data-quality-rules">How to define the Data Quality Rules</h3>
<h4 id="the-step-by-step-process">The step-by-step process</h4>
<p>The following is a simplified process to define the Data Quality Rules, step by step.</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding the data and its purpose
<ul>
<li>Why is the data is used? Understand its role in business process, reports or decision-making.</li>
<li>Who uses it? Identify key stakeholders and their expectations for the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify common issues
<ul>
<li>Review the data for frequent errors (e.g., duplicates, missing fields, invalid formats, etc.).</li>
<li>Gather feedback from users about problems they encounter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define key data quality dimensions
<ul>
<li>Focus on aspects like:
<ul>
<li>Completeness: are all required fields filed?</li>
<li>Accuracy: is the data correct and reliable?</li>
<li>Consistency: does it match across systems?</li>
<li>Timeliness: is it up-to-date?</li>
<li>Uniqueness: are there any duplicates?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write rules that address the issues you&rsquo;ve identified. Make them clear and actionable. E.g.:
<ul>
<li>Customer email not be empty.</li>
<li>Order IDs must be unique.</li>
<li>Dates must follow the format YYYY-MM-DD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Validate and Test the Rules
<ul>
<li>Apply the rules to sample data to ensure they work as intended.</li>
<li>Involve stakeholders to confirm the rules align with the business needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automate and monitor
<ul>
<li>Implement the rules in tools like ETL processes, data validation scripts, or monitoring systems.</li>
<li>Set up alerts to flag issues when data doesn&rsquo;t meet the rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review and Improve
<ul>
<li>Regularly review the rules to keep them relevant as business needs and data evolve.</li>
<li>Incorporate new feedback and insights over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All the above steps and process ensure that the data quality rules are practical relevant and effective.</p>

<p>Bellow is the analysis of the table data using the previously defined step-by-step process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding the Data and its purpose
<ul>
<li>Why is the data used?
<ul>
<li>The email addresses are used for customer communication, such a sensing invoices, marketing emails, and the account notifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who uses it?
<ul>
<li>The key stakeholders include the sales team (for promotions), the customer support team (for communication), and the marketing team (for campaigns).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify common issues
<ul>
<li>Review the data issues:
<ul>
<li>Invalid email formats (e.g., <code>jonh.smtih@email..com</code> or <code>emma@invalidemail@com</code>).</li>
<li>Missing or empty email fields.</li>
<li>Duplicate emails, which can cause communication errors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gather feedback
<ul>
<li>Marketing and customer support report failed email deliveries due to incorrect email formats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define key Data Quality dimensions
<ul>
<li>Completeness: all customers must have an email address</li>
<li>Accuracy: emails must follow the standard email format (e.g., <code>username@domain.com</code>).</li>
<li>Uniqueness: email address should not be duplicated across records.</li>
<li>Consistency: email format chould match the expected syntax and avoid errors (e.g., no multiple <code>@</code> or <code>..</code>).</li>
<li>Timeliness: email address should be updated regularly if customers change them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write rules to address the issues
<ul>
<li>Rule 1: email addresses must not be empty or null.</li>
<li>Rule 2: email addresses must follow the pattern <code>username@domain.com</code>.</li>
<li>Rule 3: each email must be unique across all customer records.</li>
<li>Rule 4: emails should not contain consecutive dots (e.g., <code>..</code>) or multiple <code>@</code> symbol.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Validate and test the rules
<ul>
<li>Apply to sample data:
<ul>
<li><code>john.smith@email.com</code> → Pass.</li>
<li><code>jonh.smtih@email..com</code> → Fail (double dot).</li>
<li><code>emma@invalidemail@com</code> → Fail (multiple <code>@</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confirm with marketing and support teams that these rules align with their expectations and address their reported issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automate and monitor
<ul>
<li>Implement these rules in a data pipeline or validation tools:
<ul>
<li>ETL: add a validation step (or task) to check email format, uniqueness and completeness.</li>
<li>Alerts: setup monitoring to flag invalid or missing emails, during data ingestion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automation:
<ul>
<li>Use a regex pattern to validate email formats: <code>^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$.</code></li>
<li>Deduplicate email addresses with a database query or script.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review and improve
<ul>
<li>Regular reviews:
<ul>
<li>Periodically audit email addresses for new issues (e.g., obsolete domains, or temporary email services, etc).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feedback loop:
<ul>
<li>Collect input from stakeholders about any new challenges, like domain-specific formatting quirks or newly encountered delivery failures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-2">What?</h4>
<pre class="mermaid align-center ">flowchart LR
    A[Input] --&gt; B[Process] --&gt; C[Output]</pre>
<p>The following is the flow of the Data Parsing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input</strong>: takes raw data (e.g., text files, JSON, XML, logs, or database entries).</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>: Analyzes and splits the data into defined parts or fields based on specific rules or patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Output</strong>: Produces structured data, such as rows and columns in a table, or a well-formed JSON object,</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<p>The following are real life <strong>Data Parsing</strong> examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log Files</strong>: parsing a log file to extract timestamps, error codes, and messages form system logs.</li>
<li><strong>JSON and XML files</strong>: parsing a JSON or XML file to break down hierarchical data into key:value pairs or relational tables.</li>
<li><strong>Text</strong>: parsing text or string like <code>jon snow, jon.snow@doomain.com, 555-123-4567</code>into separate fields, for example <code>name</code>, <code>email</code> and <code>phone</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="why-2">Why?</h4>
<p>The <strong>Data Parsing</strong> is important because it prepares raw data for analysis, storage or precessing. It is enabling systems to handle large dataset efficiently. It also ensure data is standardized, making it consistent and usable across different platform and applications.</p>

<h3 id="data-linkage">Data Linkage</h3>
<h4 id="what-5">What?</h4>
<p><strong>Data linkage</strong> is the process of connecting related records from different datasets using common identifiers or attributes. It helps create a broader, connected view of data without merging or altering individual records.</p>
<h4 id="why-5">Why?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combines data</strong> from multiple sources for better insights.</li>
<li><strong>Enables integration</strong> across systems, ensuring consistency in information.</li>
<li><strong>Supports analysis</strong> by linking different types of data (e.g., customer profiles with transaction history).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example-3">Example</h4>
<p>A hospital links patient records from different departments (e.g., lab results and doctor visits) using the patient’s ID to provide a complete medical history.</p>
<h4 id="difference-between-data-linkage-and-identity-resolution">Difference Between Data Linkage and Identity Resolution</h4>
<p>The difference between data linkage and identity resolution lies in their purpose and approach. <strong>Data linkage</strong> connects related records across different datasets, focusing on establishing relationships while keeping the records separate. In contrast, <strong>identity resolution</strong> aims to merge duplicate or fragmented records into a single, unified profile of an entity. For example, data linkage might involve linking a customer’s purchase history with their support tickets, while identity resolution would combine multiple variations of that customer’s profile (e.g., with different email addresses) into one complete record.</p>

<h3 id="data-lineage-in-data-quality-tools">Data Lineage in Data Quality Tools</h3>
<h4 id="what-22">What?</h4>
<p>Data lineage refers to the ability to track and visualize the flow of data through systems—from source to destination. It includes transformations, joins, aggregations, and movement across storage layers. Lineage can be visualized at different levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business lineage</strong>: High-level understanding of how data flows between business domains.</li>
<li><strong>Technical lineage</strong>: Step-by-step data movement and transformation through systems.</li>
<li><strong>Column-level lineage</strong>: Detailed view of how individual fields are derived.</li>

<h3 id="data-governance-policy-description">Data Governance Policy Description</h3>
<h4 id="data-governance-structure">Data Governance Structure</h4>
<p>As per Robert S. Seiner – KIK Consulting, data governance starts with policy. The policy breaks down into a set of high-level <strong>principles</strong>, and these principles are <strong>measured through data quality dimensions</strong>. This structure makes governance actionable, observable, and improvable.</p>
<pre class="mermaid align-center ">flowchart
    Policy[&#34;Data Governance Policy&#34;] --&gt; Principles[&#34;Principles&#34;]
    Principles --&gt; Dimensions[&#34;Measured by Data Quality Dimensions&#34;]</pre>
<h4 id="policy">Policy</h4>
<p>The Data Governance Policy is a formal document approved by senior management as part of the organization&rsquo;s <strong>Information Governance Mandate</strong>. It sets the foundation for how data is governed, communicated, and enforced across all levels of the business.</p>
<h4 id="principles">Principles</h4>
<p>The policy breaks down into a set of guiding principles that define the mindset and expectations around data governance, grouped according to Seiner’s color-coded model:</p>
<h4 id="data-as-a-strategic-enterprise-asset">Data as a Strategic Enterprise Asset</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data is a strategic enterprise asset</strong>: Data must be recognized as valuable to the organization.</li>
<li><strong>From &ldquo;my data&rdquo; to &ldquo;our data&rdquo;</strong>: Shifting the mindset from departmental ownership to shared organizational responsibility.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="defined-accountability">Defined Accountability</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone is responsible for data governance</strong>: All employees have a role in handling data appropriately.</li>
<li><strong>Clear accountability</strong>: Formalize who is responsible for what data and ensure responsibilities are understood and followed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compliance-and-risk-management">Compliance and Risk Management</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compliance</strong>: Ensure data use aligns with internal policies and external regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid risk and compliance issues</strong>: Prevent legal and operational issues by applying governance consistently.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="data-quality-and-consistency">Data Quality and Consistency</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistent data quality</strong>: Define and maintain data quality standards across the data lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>First time right, every time</strong>: Ensure processes are designed to get data right from the start.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h4>
<p>To measure the success of data governance, the following core data quality dimensions are monitored:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Is the data available to authorized users?</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Is the data correct and trustworthy?</li>
<li><strong>Completeness</strong>: Is any data missing?</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Does the data match across systems?</li>
<li><strong>Relevance (non-obsolete)</strong>: Is the data current and meaningful?</li>
<li><strong>Timeliness</strong>: Is the data available when needed?</li>
<li><strong>Uniqueness</strong>: Are there any duplicates or unnecessary copies?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="in-a-nutshell-24">In a Nutshell</h4>
<p>Seiner’s approach to data governance policy is built around the idea of recognizing and organizing what is already happening in the business. The policy defines how to guide and measure data governance, encourages shared responsibility, and ensures data is managed safely and effectively without disrupting day-to-day operations.</p>
<h3 id="data-governance-roles--responsibilities">Data Governance Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>
<h4 id="what-23">What</h4>

<h4 id="in-a-nutshell-26">In a Nutshell</h4>
<p>To succeed in data governance, a fintech company should treat data as a strategic asset from day one. Start small by focusing on critical domains (like customer onboarding or loan application), assign clear roles, and embed governance into the organization’s existing habits and operations. This allows the company to build trust, meet compliance needs, and improve decision-making without unnecessary friction.</p>
<p>This roadmap can serve as a starting point for creating a sustainable, scalable, and business-aligned data governance program.</p>
